## PLUGIN STATUS: THIRD-PARTY

**Important**: This appears to be a commercial third-party plugin from SnapOrbital, not custom code.

2. Includes EDD Software Licensing for updates
3. Professional plugin structure (MVC pattern)
4. License key system implemented
5. Auto-update system from vendor

## LICENSING & UPDATES

**Update System**: Uses Easy Digital Downloads Software Licensing
**License Key Location**: Stored in option `ldfc_notes_license_key`
**Update Server**: https://www.snaporbital.com
**Current Version**: 1.0.3

### Update Configuration:
```php
$edd_updater = new EDD_SL_Plugin_Updater(LDFC_STORE_URL, __FILE__, array(
    'version'   => LDFC_VER,
    'license'   => $license_key,
    'item_name' => LDFC_ITEM_NAME,
    'author'    => 'Snap Orbital',
    'url'       => home_url()
));
```

---

## ISSUES FOUND

### 1. License Key Exposure Risk
**File**: init.php
**Line**: 49
**Issue**: License key retrieved and used without encryption
```php
$license_key = trim(get_option('ldfc_notes_license_key'));
```

**Risk**: If database is compromised, license key is exposed in plain text

**Recommendation**: This is standard for EDD licensing, but consider:
- Encrypting stored license key
- Rotating keys periodically
- Monitoring key usage

**Estimated Effort**: N/A (vendor limitation)
**Action**: Accept risk or contact vendor

---

### 2. No License Validation Check
**File**: init.php
**Issue**: Plugin loads regardless of license status

**Impact**:
- Could run with expired license
- May not receive updates
- Potential security vulnerabilities if outdated

**Recommendation**:
- Add license status check
- Show admin notice if license expired
- Disable updates if license invalid

**Estimated Effort**: 2 hours (if implementing custom check)
**Action**: Check vendor documentation for built-in checks

---

### 3. Missing Local Modifications Documentation
**Issue**: Unknown if this is vanilla plugin or has customizations

**Risk**:
- Updates may overwrite customizations
- Can't track what's custom vs vendor code

**Recommendation**:
- Document any customizations
- Create child plugin for modifications
- Use hooks/filters instead of core edits

**Estimated Effort**: 2 hours (audit)
**Action**: Compare with official plugin version

This is a professionally developed commercial plugin from a reputable vendor. The main concerns are around:

1. **License Management**: Ensure license stays active
2. **Update Process**: Maintain proper testing workflow
3. **Customization Tracking**: Don't lose customizations

**Primary Action**: Remove from custom code repository and manage as a standard third-party dependency.

**Risk Level**: LOW (if properly maintained)

**Business Impact**: If updates stop, features may break with LearnDash updates. Consider budget for license renewal and periodic testing.
