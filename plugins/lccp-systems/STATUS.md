   - `modules/class-message-system.php` (18 lines, empty class)
3. Code cleanup - Remove commented code blocks
4. Performance review - Large codebase needs optimization

### Medium Priority
5. Test all 8 active modules thoroughly
6. Document custom quiz functionality
7. Review database queries for optimization
8. Consider splitting into smaller focused plugins

## Notes

This is the LARGEST and most CRITICAL custom plugin. It manages the entire LCCP certification program. Any changes need careful testing in staging before production.
