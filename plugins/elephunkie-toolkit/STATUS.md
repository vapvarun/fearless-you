# Elephunkie Toolkit - Status

**Size:** 508 KB | 3,066 lines of code
**Priority:** LOW - Unused developer tools
**Recommendation:** DELETE

## What We Have

### Features (ALL DISABLED)
24 developer tools including:
- Audio player
- Custom login
- LearnDash CSV export
- Code snippets
- Admin tweaks
- Debug tools

### Current State
- 100% of features are disabled (all toggles set to "off")
- Loading 508 KB of code on every page load
- Zero active functionality
- Taking up database space with options

## What To Do

### Immediate Action (Quick Win)
**DELETE THIS PLUGIN** - Safe to remove with ZERO impact

Steps:
```bash
wp plugin deactivate elephunkie-toolkit --allow-root
wp plugin delete elephunkie-toolkit --allow-root
```

Expected benefit:
- 5-10% instant speed improvement
- Cleaner codebase
- Less maintenance burden

### After Deletion
1. Monitor site for 48 hours
2. Confirm no functionality lost
3. Remove from repository

## What's Done

- ✅ Plugin copied to repository (for audit purposes)
- ✅ Confirmed 0% usage
- ✅ Identified as dead weight

## Notes

This is pure bloat. All 24 features are disabled. The developer likely used this for quick admin tools during development but never cleaned it up. Safe to delete immediately with no testing required.

**Status:** READY FOR DELETION
