## Why We're Keeping It

After database analysis (Oct 28, 2025):
1. **18 active users** depend on the custom roles
2. **Role management** is essential for membership site structure
3. **WP Fusion integration** for automated role assignment
4. **No equivalent** - WordPress core doesn't provide this functionality

---

## Next Steps

### ✅ Completed
- [x] Database analysis of role usage
- [x] Verified 18 active users across 3 roles
- [x] Decision made to keep plugin active

### Optional Cleanup (15 minutes)

**Delete 2 unused roles using User Role Editor plugin:**

1. Install User Role Editor plugin (free from WordPress.org)
   ```bash
   wp plugin install user-role-editor --activate
   ```

2. Go to WordPress Admin > Users > User Role Editor

3. Delete these roles:
   - `fearless_you_subscriber` (0 users assigned)
   - `fearless_you_pending` (0 users assigned)

4. Keep these roles:
   - `fearless_you_member` (9 users - DO NOT DELETE)
   - `fearless_faculty` (4 users - DO NOT DELETE)
   - `fearless_ambassador` (5 users - DO NOT DELETE)

**Why it's optional:** The unused roles don't hurt anything, they just clutter the role list.
