   ❌ ID 220274 - /welcome-to-fearless-you/ [OLD VERSION - RECOMMEND DELETE]
   ⚠️ ID 2 - /dashboard/ [ORIGINAL 2022 VERSION - CHECK IF LINKED]

   ⚠️ ID 6 - /members/ [OLDER - Mar 2022]
   Note: Both appear to be empty. Determine which is correct.

3. PAGES WITH NO SLUG (Potential Issues)
-----------------------------------------
   Draft pages with missing slugs that might cause issues:
   - ID 228859: Coaches Toolkit Training
   - ID 228574: Toolkit Certification
   - ID 220272: Home

==========================================

RECOMMENDATIONS:
================

HIGH PRIORITY:
--------------
1. Delete duplicate "Welcome to Fearless You!" page
   - DELETE ID 220274 (old version from 2023)
   - Keep ID 222497 (current front page)
   - Review ID 2 (dashboard) - check if any menus/links reference it

2. Resolve "Members" duplicate
   - Determine which Members page is correct (ID 6 or ID 230024)
   - Delete the unused one

MEDIUM PRIORITY:
----------------
3. Clean up old draft pages
   - Review drafts from 2022 (IDs: 255, 254, 243, 230, 30, 5, 3)
   - These are 3+ years old and likely not needed
   - Recommended: DELETE if not actively being worked on

4. Fix pages with no slug
   - Either complete these drafts or delete them
   - Pages without slugs can cause admin confusion

LOW PRIORITY:
-------------
5. Review recent drafts
   - ID 229229: Test Page - probably safe to delete
   - ID 228859, 228574: Toolkit pages - check if being developed

==========================================

RECOMMENDED IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:
==============================

1. DELETE ID 220274 - Old "Welcome to Fearless You!" (2023)
   Reason: Duplicate of active front page

2. CHECK & DELETE ONE: ID 6 or ID 230024 (Members pages)
   Action needed: Determine which Members page should be kept

3. DELETE TEST PAGE: ID 229229 (Test Page draft)
   Reason: Clearly a test, likely not needed

4. REVIEW & DELETE OLD DRAFTS from 2022:
   IDs: 255, 254, 243, 230, 30, 5, 3
   Reason: 3+ years old, likely abandoned

==========================================

SUMMARY:
========
- 2 confirmed duplicate pages found
- 12 old draft pages (3+ years old)
- 3 pages with missing slugs
- Estimated cleanup: 15-17 pages can be deleted

IMPACT:
=======
✓ Cleaner admin interface
✓ Faster page load times in admin
✓ Reduced database size
✓ Less confusion for content editors
✓ No impact on live site (only drafts and duplicates)
