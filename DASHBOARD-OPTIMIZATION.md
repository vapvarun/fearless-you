## Why We Had Duplicates

LearnDash already provides:
- Quiz Reports → `LearnDash > Reports > Quizzes`
- Course Progress → `LearnDash > Reports > User Progress`
- Assignments → `LearnDash > Reports > Assignments`

We duplicated these on the dashboard instead of using LearnDash's built-in reports.

**Solution:** Deleted duplicates, kept only LCCP-specific features (hour tracking, team hierarchy).

## Files Modified

1. `class-enhanced-dashboards.php` - Consolidated to 5 widgets
2. `class-learndash-widgets.php` - **DELETED**
3. `class-dashboards-module.php` - Removed duplicate widget
4. `class-module-manager.php` - Removed references to deleted files

CSS/JS:
- `assets/css/dashboard-widgets.css` - WordPress-standard styles
- `assets/js/dashboard-widgets.js` - AJAX handlers
