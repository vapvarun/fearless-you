# LCCP Systems Dashboard Widgets Optimization Report

**Date:** October 28, 2025
**Prepared For:** Fearless Living - LCCP Systems
**Subject:** Dashboard Widget Streamlining Recommendations

---

## Executive Summary

The LCCP Systems plugin currently registers **22 dashboard widgets** across different user roles. Our analysis reveals significant overlap and redundancy that may be overwhelming users and cluttering the WordPress dashboard experience.

**Recommendation:** Reduce to **5-8 essential widgets** for improved user experience and dashboard performance.

## Current State Analysis

### Widget Count by File

| File Location | Widget Count | Purpose |
|---------------|--------------|---------|
| `class-enhanced-dashboards.php` | 11 widgets | Core LCCP functionality |
| `class-learndash-widgets.php` | 10 widgets | Learning management |
| `class-dashboards-module.php` | 1 widget | System overview |
| **Total** | **22 widgets** | |

### Widget Distribution by Role

| User Role | Access Level | Widgets Shown |
|-----------|--------------|---------------|
| Administrator/Rhonda | 100 | 22 widgets (all) |
| Mentor | 75 | 19 widgets |
| Big Bird | 50 | 17 widgets |

## Problem Statement

### Issues Identified

1. **Dashboard Clutter**
   - 22 widgets create visual overwhelm
   - Difficult to find important information quickly
   - Excessive scrolling required

2. **Duplicate Functionality**
