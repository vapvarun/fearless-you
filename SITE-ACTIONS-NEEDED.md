## FINAL DECISION: KEEP BOTH PLUGINS ✅

The Faculty Dashboard provides valuable analytics that justify keeping the custom plugins:
- **18 users** depend on the 3 active roles
- **4 faculty users** have access to comprehensive membership analytics
- **Analytics dashboard** integrates data from multiple sources (WordPress, LearnDash, WP Fusion, Events)
- **500KB of code** provides specialized functionality not available in WordPress core

---

## ACTIONS COMPLETED

✅ **Database Analysis**: Verified 18 users across 3 active roles
✅ **Shortcode Usage**: Confirmed Faculty Dashboard page in use
✅ **Decision Made**: Keep both plugins active

## OPTIONAL: Clean Up Unused Roles

The plugins created 5 roles, but only 3 are in use. You can optionally delete the 2 unused roles:

### Using User Role Editor Plugin

1. Install User Role Editor plugin (free from WordPress.org)
2. Go to Users > User Role Editor
3. Delete these roles (0 users assigned):
   - **fearless_you_subscriber**
   - **fearless_you_pending**

**Note**: The 3 active roles (fearless_you_member, fearless_faculty, fearless_ambassador) should remain - 18 users depend on them.

## Dashboard Maintenance (Optional)

For best results, verify these integrations are configured:

**WP Fusion / Keap**:
- Subscription status tracking (active/paused/canceled)
- Churn rate calculations

**The Events Calendar**:
- Currently shows hardcoded events
- Could be enhanced to pull from real Events Calendar data

**LearnDash**:
- Course enrollment tracking (already working)

**BuddyBoss / bbPress**:
- Forum activity tracking (already working)

See **FACULTY-DASHBOARD-TESTING.md** for detailed testing checklist.
