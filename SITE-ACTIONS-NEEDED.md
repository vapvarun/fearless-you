## DECISION: KEEP PLUGINS (For Now)

The Faculty Dashboard provides a comprehensive analytics system. Before deleting, we need to evaluate:

### Phase 1: Test Faculty Dashboard Functionality

**Test the dashboard page:**
1. Log in as one of the 4 faculty users OR admin
2. Visit `/faculty-dashboard/` page (ID: 229366)
3. Check what data is actually displaying:
   - [ ] Are membership metrics showing correctly?
   - [ ] Is the subscription breakdown accurate?
   - [ ] Do the charts render properly?
   - [ ] Are upcoming events displaying?
   - [ ] Do the "Quick Action" buttons work?

**Check data integrations:**
- [ ] WP Fusion/Keap - Is subscription data syncing?
- [ ] LearnDash - Are course enrollments counting correctly?
- [ ] Events Calendar - Are upcoming events pulling in?
- [ ] bbPress - Is forum activity tracking?

### Phase 2: User Feedback

**Ask the 4 faculty users:**
- Do you use the Faculty Dashboard page?
- Which metrics/features do you actually use?
- Could you get this info elsewhere (WordPress admin, LearnDash reports)?

### Phase 3: Make Decision

**If dashboard IS being used:**
- Keep both plugins
- Consider this 500KB of code as providing value

**If dashboard is NOT being used:**
- Delete plugins
- Replace Faculty Dashboard page with simple HTML links
- Manage roles with User Role Editor plugin

---

## OPTIONAL: Clean Up Unused Roles

Can be done now with User Role Editor:
- [ ] Install User Role Editor plugin (optional, for managing roles)
- [ ] Delete **fearless_you_subscriber** role (0 users)
- [ ] Delete **fearless_you_pending** role (0 users)

These 2 unused roles can be deleted whether we keep the plugins or not.
