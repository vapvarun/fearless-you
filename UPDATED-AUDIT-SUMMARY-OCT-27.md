---

## Critical Issues Found (New)

### 1. LCCP: Inefficient Module Loading
**Problem**: Loads ALL module files even if disabled
**Impact**: ~100 KB unnecessary code per request
**Fix**: Update module manager to check status before loading
**Effort**: 2 hours

### 2. LCCP: Dashboard Code Duplication
**Problem**: 3 separate dashboard files (84 KB) doing similar things
**Impact**: Maintenance burden, code redundancy
**Fix**: Consolidate into single class
**Effort**: 3-4 hours

### 3. LCCP: Stub Files Not Cleaned Up
**Problem**: 2 stub module files loaded but do nothing
**Impact**: Wasted parsing time
**Fix**: Delete `class-mentor-system.php` and `class-message-system.php`
**Effort**: 2 minutes

### 4. Plugin Overlap - Role Management
**Problem**: 3 plugins manage roles (LCCP, Roles Manager, FYS)
**Impact**: Confusion, duplicate code
**Fix**: Consolidate to Fearless Roles Manager
**Effort**: 4-6 hours

### 5. Plugin Overlap - Dashboards
**Problem**: 3 plugins have dashboard systems
**Impact**: Maintenance complexity
**Fix**: Standardize on LCCP dashboards (most complete)
**Effort**: 2-3 hours

### 6. Plugin Overlap - Autologin
**Problem**: LCCP has autologin module + Magic Login plugin exists
**Impact**: Duplicate functionality
**Fix**: Disable LCCP autologin module
**Effort**: 1 hour

---

## Performance Issues Discovered

### Database Bloat (High Priority)
- **1,819 autoloaded options** (should be 100-200)
- **312 KB autoload size** (should be <100 KB)
- **100 spam security log entries** (from disabled Elephunkie module)

### Plugin Overhead
- **Elephunkie: 100% dead weight** (all 24 features disabled, still loading)
- **LCCP: Loads disabled modules** (~100 KB wasted)
- **68+ LCCP options** autoloaded on every request

### Expected Performance Gains After Cleanup

### Quick Wins:
"We can get you a 40-60% performance boost in under 2 hours by removing dead weight and cleaning the database."

### Timeline:
"Original estimate was 9 days. Updated estimate is 13-15 days total. However, we can do the critical work in phases, with immediate performance improvements in Week 1."

### Investment:
- **Phase 0** (2 hours): Immediate performance boost
- **Phase 1** (13.5 hours): Critical security
- **Phase 2** (7 hours): LCCP optimization
- **Phase 3** (6 hours): Database cleanup

**Total for immediate needs: ~28 hours (3.5 days)**
