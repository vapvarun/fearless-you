# FLI Child Theme - Status

**Size:** 2.4 MB
**Parent Theme:** BuddyBoss Theme
**Priority:** MEDIUM - Active customizations

## What We Have

### Customizations
- Custom functions.php with site-specific code
- Style overrides for BuddyBoss theme
- Template overrides (if any)
- Custom CSS/JS assets
- BuddyBoss Platform integration

### Backup Files Found
- `functions-backup-original.php` - Old backup that should be excluded from git

## What To Do

### High Priority
1. Review functions.php for:
   - Unused code
   - Performance issues
   - Security concerns
2. Identify which template files are overridden
3. Document all customizations

### Medium Priority
4. Check if CSS/JS is minified for production
5. Review asset loading - ensure conditional loading
6. Verify compatibility with latest BuddyBoss version

### Low Priority
7. Organize functions.php into logical sections
8. Add code comments for custom functions
9. Consider moving large customizations to a custom plugin

## What's Done

- ✅ Theme copied to repository
- ✅ Backup files identified
- ✅ Excluded from git tracking

## Notes

Child themes are the correct way to customize BuddyBoss. Need to audit functions.php to see what's customized and ensure it's all still needed. Some functionality might be better suited for a custom plugin rather than theme functions.
