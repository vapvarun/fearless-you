## What To Do

### High Priority
1. Review functions.php for:
   - Unused code
   - Performance issues
   - Security concerns
2. Identify which template files are overridden
3. Document all customizations

### Medium Priority
4. Check if CSS/JS is minified for production
5. Review asset loading - ensure conditional loading
6. Verify compatibility with latest BuddyBoss version

### Low Priority
7. Organize functions.php into logical sections
8. Add code comments for custom functions
9. Consider moving large customizations to a custom plugin

## Notes

Child themes are the correct way to customize BuddyBoss. Need to audit functions.php to see what's customized and ensure it's all still needed. Some functionality might be better suited for a custom plugin rather than theme functions.
