# FLI Child Theme - Status

**Size:** 2.4 MB
**Parent Theme:** BuddyBoss Theme
**Priority:** MEDIUM - Active customizations

## What We Have

### Core Files
- `functions.php` - Main theme functionality
- `style.css` - Theme stylesheet

### Assets
- Custom CSS in `assets/css/`
- Custom JS in `assets/js/`
- Template overrides in `template-parts/`
- BuddyBoss Platform integration

### Removed Directories (Now Clean)
- ❌ `includes/` - REMOVED (all files deleted)
- ❌ `inc/` - REMOVED (all files deleted)

## What To Do

### High Priority
1. Review functions.php for:
   - Unused code
   - Performance issues
   - Security concerns
2. Identify which template files are overridden
3. Document all customizations

### Medium Priority
4. Check if CSS/JS is minified for production
5. Review asset loading - ensure conditional loading
6. Verify compatibility with latest BuddyBoss version

### Low Priority
7. Organize functions.php into logical sections
8. Add code comments for custom functions
9. Consider moving large customizations to a custom plugin

## What's Done

- ✅ Theme copied to repository
- ✅ Include files audit completed (Oct 27, 2025)
- ✅ Removed 3 unused include files (50 KB):
  - `enable-breadcrumbs.php` - unused breadcrumb system
  - `magic-link-auth.php` - unused passwordless login (35 KB!)
  - `membership-caching-examples.php` - just example/demo code
- ✅ Removed 3 backup files (115 KB):
  - `functions-backup-original.php`
  - `functions.php.backup`
  - `custom-fivo-docs.js.backup`
- ✅ **Removed debug/development code for production (Oct 27, 2025):**
  - `error-logging.php` (18 KB) - debug logging system with admin menu
  - `caching-system.php` (22 KB) - custom caching (use caching plugin instead)
  - Removed require statements from functions.php
  - **Reason:** No debug code on live site, caching handled by plugins
- ✅ **Removed ALL unused include/admin files (Oct 27, 2025):**
  - `includes/other-options-handler.php` (25 KB) - AJAX handlers for unused page
  - `includes/role-based-logo.php` (4 KB) - logo switcher (no users with those roles)
  - `includes/class-fli-image-upload-handler.php` (12 KB) - unused shortcodes
  - `inc/admin/admin-init.php` - admin menu for non-existent options
  - `inc/admin/theme-functions.php` - helper functions for non-existent options
  - `inc/admin/dynamic-styles.php` - CSS generator never called
  - `inc/admin/category-colors.php` (14 KB) - depends on non-existent Redux options
  - `inc/admin/options-init.php` (16 KB) - Redux config never used
  - `inc/learndash-customizer.php` (17 KB) - never included
  - **Removed entire `includes/` and `inc/` directories**
- ✅ **Total cleanup:** ~330 KB removed, 16 files + 2 directories deleted

## Notes

Child themes are the correct way to customize BuddyBoss. Need to audit functions.php to see what's customized and ensure it's all still needed. Some functionality might be better suited for a custom plugin rather than theme functions.
